Using Mysql and node.js to create a mock store
----------------------------------------------

I have created a store where you can choose a sporting product from a mock Amazon store. Once chosen and purchased, it will update the database.

(I am still working on fixing the bugs, but there is some direction in the code showing what is going to happen)

Here is the output so far:
-------------------------

connected as id: 86
Printing id, product name and price from Bamazon:


[ RowDataPacket { id: 1, product_name: 'camping tarp', price: 325 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 2, product_name: 'headlamp', price: 25.99 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 3, product_name: 'road bike', price: 999.99 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 4, product_name: 'mountain bike', price: 1499.99 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 5, product_name: 'trail shoes', price: 120 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 6, product_name: 'hydration vest', price: 134 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 7, product_name: 'titanium cookset', price: 120 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 8, product_name: 'running watch', price: 250 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 9, product_name: 'wool balaclava', price: 30 },
  RowDataPacket { id: 10, product_name: 'wool baselayer', price: 99.99 } ]
? What is the ID number of the product you want to buy? 5
? What is the quantity you want to purchase? 2
